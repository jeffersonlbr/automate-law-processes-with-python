##Project
The idea of creating this bot was developed in response to a client's need to automate a manual data collection process from PJE (Electronic Judicial Process): https://pje1g.trf3.jus.br/pje/ConsultaPublica/listView.seam

##Steps
- Need to extract information from a specific legal class (name, CPF, case number, and others).
- Once this is done, it's necessary for these pieces of information to be entered into an Excel spreadsheet.

#Tools
Using python it was needed only two libraries: selenium and openpyxl
- 'selenium' to automate browsers
- 'openpyxl' to automate spreadsheets
